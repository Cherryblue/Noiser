# ðŸ“£Noiser Icon Font

## Creation process
Noiser Icon Font is made of as many svg as there are icons. Each icon is a vector drawing, saved as a seperate SVG.
You can create SVGs with any vector tool. Inkscape is one. Noiser's were made using Figma.

## Packaging icons as a font
While this can be done "by hand", this is a tedious process which can be simplified by various online alternatives.
Noiser icons font was made by embedding the svg files together using [Nucleo App](https://nucleoapp.com/).
